# Deliver a daily bank statement

This example turns one day's transactions from a core banking system into a Xero bank statement and delivers it to an existing feed connection. It works out the closing balance from the opening balance and the transactions, sends the statement with an idempotency key so a retry of the same day is safe, and checks the delivery status Xero reports. It then pages through the statements already delivered and counts those for the feed connection by status.

## Prerequisites

- A Xero app with the `bankfeeds` scope, a refresh token and a tenant ID, as described in the [setup guide](../../ballerina/README.md#setup-guide). The Bank Feeds API is only available to approved Xero financial services partners.
- An active feed connection to deliver the statement to. The [bank feed connection lifecycle](../bank_feed_connection_lifecycle/bank_feed_connection_lifecycle.md) example creates one.
- Push the connector to the local repository:
  ```bash
  cd ../../ballerina
  bal pack && bal push --repository=local
  ```
- Create a `Config.toml` in this directory:
  ```toml
  clientId = "<CLIENT_ID>"
  clientSecret = "<CLIENT_SECRET>"
  refreshToken = "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
  refreshUrl = "https://identity.xero.com/connect/token"
  tenantId = "<TENANT_ID>"
  feedConnectionId = "<FEED_CONNECTION_ID>"
  # The statement date, in YYYY-MM-DD format. It can be no older than one year.
  statementDate = "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
  # The account balance at the start of the day. A negative value is an overdrawn balance.
  openingBalance = 1500.00
  ```

## Run the example

```bash
bal run
```
